Find some libraries and examples below to further enhance the feature set of your Reaflow app!

## Zooming and panning
> Super fast and light react npm package for zooming, panning and pinching html elements in easy way

[React-zoom-pan-pinch](https://github.com/prc5/react-zoom-pan-pinch): By wrapping the Reaflow graph in the `TransformWrapper` of this library Mobile gestures, touchpad gestures and desktop mouse events are enabled. The graph can be scrolled via the mouse wheel and panned by dragging the canvas. The library provides a rich interface for interaction events.

Property highlights:
- `wheel={{step: 40}}` - Define the zoom steps for each mouse wheel step
- `minScale` and `maxScale` - Define the minimum and maximum zoom
- `limitToBounds` - Define if the graph should be allowed to be pannable out of the view

To mitigate complications, make sure to deactivate the Reaflow-native zoom feature by setting `zoomable={false}`.
```
import { TransformWrapper, TransformComponent } from "react-zoom-pan-pinch";
...
<TransformWrapper
    wheel={{step: 40}}
    options={{
        maxScale: 4,
        limitToBounds: false,
    }}
>
    <TransformComponent>
        <Canvas
            zoomable={false}
            fit={true}
            nodes={...}
            edges={...}
        />
    </TransformComponent>
</TransformWrapper>
```
